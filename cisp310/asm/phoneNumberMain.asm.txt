; Assignment:
; Use the template console32 package to complete this lab.
; Write a complete assembly language program to compute the expression
; 2(−a + b − 1) + c
; where
;   a is the area code of your phone number
;   b is the first three digits of your phone number
;   c is the last four digits of your phone number
; Create a Google Doc, saved as a PDF, that contains the following information:
;   1. a discussion of your choice of size for this problem. Include all the intermediate calculated values and justify your choice. You must choose the smallest register size possible.
;   2. A discussion of signed or unsigned integers for this problem.  Justify your choice with data.
;   3. An image of your main.asm file. Include in the comments the data that is held in each of the registers that you use in the problem (a Register Dictionary).
;   4. Multiple screen shots of a line-by-line execution of the program. After each calculation show the result as hexadecimal and decimal, and the EFLAGS bit showing the result of the calculation is mathematically correct.
; Name your PDF whatever you like. Upload it before the due date and time.

phone_a   WORD    916d    ; area code of phone number
phone_b   WORD    205d    ; first 3 digits of phone number
phone_c   WORD    0468d   ; last 4 digits of phone number
result  WORD    0h; ; this will store the result of 2(-phone_a + phone_b - 1) + phone_c
; All of these should be interpreted as being signed
