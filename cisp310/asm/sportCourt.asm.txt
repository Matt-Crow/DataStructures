;   Assignment:
;       Write a console32 Assembly Language program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangular sports court in meters.
;       Assume the largest size will be a regulation Bundesliga (German professional league) soccer field.
;       Justify the size and unsigned/signed you choose for this problem.
;       Do the problem using only registers and hard-coded data.
;       In other words, no user input.
;       Each execution will be for a fixed set of initial data.
;       You may use named memory if that makes sense to you.

;   The largest dimensions of a soccer field are 105m by 68m
;   dimensions are lengths, so they cannot be negative, so therefore, I will use all unsigned values
;   The largest perimeter possible is 105m + 105m + 68m + 68m = 346m, which goes beyond the size of a BYTE
;   as such, I must store all the data as the next size up, a WORD

.DATA
court_width    WORD    105d ; apparently, "width" is a reserved word
court_length  WORD    68d
court_perimeter WORD  0d

.CODE
main    PROC
    ; I will store intermediate values in the A register as an arbitrary choice.
    mov AX, 0d
    ; initialize the last WORD sized part of A to 0.

    add AX, court_width ; AX = court_width
    add AX, court_width ; AX = 2*court_width
    add AX, court_length ; AX = 2*court_width + court_length
    add AX, court_length ; AX = 2*court_width + 2*court_length = the perimeter

    mov court_perimeter, AX ; done with calculating, so store the value.

    mov AX, 0
    ret
main    ENDP
